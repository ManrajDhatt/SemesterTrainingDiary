# Day 2 - Continuing Work on Emulator Setup

## Overview
The focus of the day was to set up and run the Flutter emulator on an older Intel architecture MacBook. While the process has been challenging, significant efforts were made to troubleshoot and resolve compatibility issues.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Outdated Architecture**: The older Intel architecture posed challenges in compatibility with the latest tools and frameworks.
2. **Commands Attempted**:
   - `flutter outdated`
   - `flutter update`
   - `flutter pub cache clean`
   - `flutter pub get`
3. **Ruby Installation Issues**:
   - Tried utilizing Ruby for setup, but the process stopped midway due to system support limitations.

## Lessons Learned
- Compatibility issues can significantly impact development workflow on older systems.
- The importance of reading system requirements and pre-requisites for smooth installations.

## Current Status
- Despite multiple attempts, the emulator has not been successfully set up yet.
- Research is ongoing to identify a workaround or alternative solutions.

## Next Steps
- Explore virtualization options or alternative emulators compatible with older MacBooks.
- Seek guidance from Flutter documentation and community forums.
