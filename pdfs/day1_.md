# Day 1 - Flutter Project Setup and Configuration

The first day of my training was an exciting learning experience, as I focused on running a pre-built Flutter project on my MacBookâ€”an environment I was not previously familiar with. Flutter, being a comprehensive framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, intrigued me with its potential for cross-platform development.

## Key Highlights of Day 1:

- **Installation and Configuration:**  
  The primary objective for today was to correctly set up the Flutter SDK and ensure that the necessary development tools were configured properly on macOS. I began by downloading Flutter and ensuring that all dependencies, including Xcode and Android Studio, were installed without any hitches.

- **Troubleshooting and Resolving Errors:**  
  As I progressed, I encountered a few errors during the installation and configuration process. Through diligent troubleshooting, I was able to resolve issues such as missing dependencies, incorrect path settings, and build errors in the pre-built Flutter project. I also learned to use the `flutter doctor` command, which helped identify potential issues and guided me in troubleshooting them effectively.

- **Running the Pre-Built Flutter Project:**  
  After successfully installing and configuring Flutter, I focused on running the pre-built Flutter project. This involved resolving any project-specific errors and ensuring that all dependencies were correctly linked. After addressing these issues, I was able to launch the project on both the iOS and Android simulators, which was a moment of accomplishment.

## Learnings:

- **Flutter Setup:**  
  I gained valuable experience in setting up Flutter on macOS, understanding the intricacies of macOS development, and ensuring that the necessary tools (Xcode, Android Studio, etc.) were configured correctly for a seamless Flutter development environment.

- **Problem Solving:**  
  The errors I encountered were excellent learning opportunities, helping me improve my troubleshooting skills and gain confidence in resolving common issues that developers face when setting up their development environment.

Overall, Day 1 laid a strong foundation for my training, and I am eager to continue exploring the capabilities of Flutter in the coming days.
