# **Day 4 (20-01-2025): Transition to Android Studio and App Debugging**

---

## **Task Overview**
- 🚀 **Shift to Android Studio:**  
  Due to performance limitations and missing features in **VSCode**, we transitioned to **Android Studio** for running the `ApnaBiznas` project on an emulator.
  
---

## **Debugging and Setup**
- 🛠️ **FVM Commands Executed:**
  1. **Clean Project:**  
     ```bash
     fvm flutter clean
     ```
     Removed cached files and potential build issues.
  2. **Set Flutter Version:**  
     ```bash
     fvm use 3.19.2
     ```
     Ensured the project used the correct Flutter version for compatibility.

- ✅ **Outcome:** Post cleanup and version setup, the project executed successfully, and the app ran smoothly on the emulator.
