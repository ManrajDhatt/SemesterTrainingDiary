### 🚀 Project Initialization
Today, we kickstarted the SOIT website project using **Next.js** as the tech stack.

### ✅ Key Tasks:
- Bootstrapped the project with `create-next-app`.
- Implemented the initial **project structure** with:
  - `Navbar.tsx`
  - `Footer.tsx`
  - `ThemeToggle.tsx`
- Added dark/light mode support using **TailwindCSS + Context API**.
- Created basic page routes: Home, About, Courses, Contact.
